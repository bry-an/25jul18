Clearfix makes it so that the parent element knows the size of the child element. 
	Use when you see a floated element not staying in its parent element.

Positioning
	Best to generally use static positioning (and not floats)
	Default: static
	Relative: use left: 10px, etc to change
		left: 40px would push from *left* (i.e. move right)
	Absolute: positioned relative to nearest non-statically positioned ancestor
	Fixed: Orients relative to browser window (things that follow with while you scroll)
	Z-index: allows you to layer elements on top of each other when they're positioned
		Only matters with non-static images
		e.g. z-index: 1 <-- 1 is static order, lowest. 2 would go on top
	Hiding: display: none; // probably use with JS
		Takes away the space that the element uses, as opposed to visibility: hidden
